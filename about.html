                <p>I am a cartographer and developer interested in telling the stories of communities through maps and technology.  I have helped local governments and non-profits tell their stories through maps for print, interactive web maps, and websites.</p>
                <p>Most of my professional experience has been working with county governments.  I have also completed freelance projects for non-profits and web development companies.</p>
                <p>Some projects I'm especially proud of are redesigning the <a href="../assets/documents/Camp_Swatara_ANSI_A_11-10-2018.pdf" download>hiking trails map</a> for Camp Swatara, and creating the Cumberland County <a href="https://gis.ccpa.net/sld/activity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subdivision &#38; Land Development Plans Map</a>.</p>
