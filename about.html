                <p>I am a cartographer and developer interested in telling the stories of communities through maps and technology.  I have helped local governments and non-profits tell their stories through maps for print, interactive web maps, and websites.</p>
                <p>Most of my professional experience has been working with county governments.  I have also completed freelance projects for non-profits and web development companies.</p>
             <p>Some projects I'm especially proud of are building a <a href="https://mckinneypartyof5.life/">blogging site</a> with my wife, redesigning the <a href="../assets/documents/CampSwatara_HikingTrailsMap_07132018.pdf" target="_blank">hiking trails map (pdf)</a> for Camp Swatara, and creating the Cumberland County <a href="https://gis.ccpa.net/maps/recycling-disposal/" target="_blank">Residential Recycling &#38; Disposal Map</a>.</p>

                <p>I also have a strong passion for open source technologies and educating the mapping profession on how to integrate these into their workflows.  Below are some talks I have given and projects I contribute to on GitHub.</p>
