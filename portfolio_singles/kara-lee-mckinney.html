                <p>My first experience building a website from the ground up was my wifeâ€™s blogging site, built with Wordpress.  I worked with her in selecting a theme, integrating various plugins, and customizing the design of her site.</p>  
                <p>I am also managing updates to the site, as well as building in additional functionality as needed.  Changes and enhancements are tested on a local version of the site, and then ported over to the live site.</p>
