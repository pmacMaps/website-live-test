                <p>The Cumberland County Recycling &#38; Disposal Map application was developed to provide residents of Cumberland County with information about solid waste and recycling in their municipality.  The map was built using the Leaflet.js library and several plugins.  The framework for the map uses the <a href="https://github.com/bmcbride/bootleaf" target="_blank">BootLeaf</a> project, which is a full-page map app template using Bootstrap.</p>
                <p>Information related to the map, including a legend, are accessible from modal windows.  There are several ways a user can find information about their municipality/address:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Locate Me widget</li>
                    <li>Address Search widget</li>
                    <li>Municipality Search widget</li>
                    <li>Mouse-over popup for each municipality</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Users can also change the basemap, turn the thematic layers on/off, and click on thematic layers to access a pop-up with information for each feature.</p>
