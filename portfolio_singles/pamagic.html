                <p>The Pennsylvania Mapping and Geographic Information Consortium (PaMAGIC) is a non-profit organization serving geospatial professionals in the state of Pennsylvania.  The organization had a vision to develop a new website that would allow access to members-only content, as well as allow members to search the membership database.</p>
                <p>To achieve these goals, the organization took over management of their website.  As I was serving on the board during this time, I was assigned as the project lead.  The major steps were  transferring domain name ownership, purchasing a web hosting plan, and developing a new site on the Drupal platform.</p>
                <p>While some of the features were realized with Drupal, the Board decided to switch to the Wild Apricot platform.  This will allow better integration of the website and membership management.  The transition to Wild Apricot occured in early 2021.</p>
