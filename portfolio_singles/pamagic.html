                <p>The Pennsylvania Mapping and Geographic Information Consortium (PaMAGIC) is a non-profit organization serving geospatial professionals in the state of Pennsylvania.  The organization had a vision to develop a new website that would allow access to members-only content, as well as allow members to search the membership database.</p>
                <p>To achieve these goals, the organization took over management of their website.  As I was serving on the board during this time, I was assigned as the project lead.  The major steps were  transferring domain name ownership, purchasing a web hosting plan, and developing a new site on the Drupal platform.</p>
                <p>The redesigned site is responsive and currently allows for members-only content.  Additional functionality is being developed on a test site, and then ported over to the live site.  My ongoing responsibilities include administering the website (updates, users, etc.) and developing new functionality.</p>
