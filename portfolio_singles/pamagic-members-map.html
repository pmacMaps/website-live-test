                <p>The PaMAGIC Members Map was developed to visualize the locations of members of the Pennsylvania Mapping and Geographic Information Consortium, provide basic information about each member, and allow users to search for members.</p>
                <p>The web map application integrates the Leaflet.js library and the Esri <a href="https://github.com/Esri/calcite-maps" target="_blank">Calcite Maps</a> project.  Calcite Maps is web map template based on Bootstrap.  Users can search for a street address or PAMAGIC member using the Esri Leaflet Geocoding plugin.</p>
