                <p>During my time working with the Lancaster County Planning Commission, one of my favorite cartographic projects was designing the Heritage Byway map series.  Two byways were adopted during my tenure. </p>
                <p>The goal of the project was to develop a standard layout and design for a series of maps telling the story of the byway.  The maps in the atlas included the Concept Plan, Historic &#38; Cultural Resources, Natural &#38; Recreational Resources, Agricultural Resources, Viewshed Analysis, Transportation Issues, Generalized Zoning, and Existing Land Use.</p>
