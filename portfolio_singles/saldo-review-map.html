                <p>This web map app was developed for the Cumberland County Planning Commission.  It shows subdivision and land development plans that have been reviewed by the Planning office.  Planning staff add points to the map using a secured feature service on ArcGIS Portal.  A non-editable public map service pointing to the same dataset is displayed on this web map.</p>
                <p>By default, the app displays any plans reviewed in the current year.  There are multiple ways for users to change the date filter:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Select a start and end date</li>
                    <li>Select a single year</li>
                    <li>Select multiple years</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The technology stack for this app includes Leaflet.js, various Leaflet plugins, Esri REST services, Bootstrap, jQuery, and jQuery UI.</p>
