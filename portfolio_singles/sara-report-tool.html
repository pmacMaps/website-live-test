                <p>The SARA Risk Radius Analysis Tool is a custom ArcGIS tool developed to assist the Cumberland County Public Safety department in their SARA Tier II reporting.  The tool performs a series of analyses on sites with certain quantities of hazardous chemicals.  The results of the analysis go into a plan for each site.  The user enters in the latitude and longitude for the site, a unique ID for the site, the distances for the risk radii, the units for the risk radii, and a folder location for output files.</p>
                <p>There are four Python scripts comprising the tool:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>SARAReportTool.py</strong> obtains the user inputs from the toolâ€™s dialog window, and imports functions from the other three scripts.</li>
                    <li><strong>riskRadius.py</strong> converts a latitude and longitude coordinate pair from the WGS 1984 geographic coordinate system into a projected coordinate system, and creates the risk radii (multi-ring buffers).</li>
                    <li><strong>populationEstimate.py</strong> loops through each risk radius and calculates the proportional population in each risk radius using U.S. Census block data.</li>
                    <li><strong>vulnerableFacilities.py</strong> loops through each risk radius and selects any vulnerable facilities within each radius.  The selected vulnerable facilities are exported to a Microsoft Excel file.</li>
                </ol>
