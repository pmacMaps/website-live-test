                <p>The SARA Risk Radius Analysis Tool is a custom ArcGIS tool developed to assist the Cumberland County Public Safety department in their SARA Tier II reporting.  The tool performs a series of analyses on sites with certain quantities of hazardous chemicals.  The results of the analysis go into a plan for each site.  The user enters in the latitude and longitude coordinates for the facility, information about the facility (name, address, state-issued ID), the chemical the analysis is being performed for, the distance(s) and units for the risk radii buffers, and a folder location for output files.</p>
                <p>There are eight Python modules (scripts) comprising the tool:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>SARAReportTool.py</strong> obtains the user inputs from the ArcGIS toolâ€™s dialog window, and imports functions from the other modules.</li>
                    <li><strong>riskRadius.py</strong> converts a latitude and longitude coordinate pair from the WGS 1984 geographic coordinate system into a projected coordinate system, and creates the risk radii (multi-ring buffers).</li>
                    <li><strong>floodplainAnalysis.py</strong> identifies if the building footprint associated with the facility is within a FEMA floodplain.</li>
                    <li><strong>populationEstimate.py</strong> loops through each risk radius and calculates the proportional population in each risk radius using U.S. Census block data.</li>
                    <li><strong>vulnerableFacilities.py</strong> loops through each risk radius and selects any vulnerable facilities within each radius.  The selected vulnerable facilities are exported to a Microsoft Excel file.</li>
                    <li><strong>createMap.py</strong> takes a template ArcMap document and creates a new document centered on the facility and risk radii generated.  Various layout elements are updated based upon user inputs.  A .pdf export of the map is also generated.</li>
                    <li><strong>exportLayersToExcel.py</strong> is a helper function that exports the list of vulnerable facilities that intersect each risk radius to Microsoft Excel format.</li>
                    <li><strong>errorLogger.py</strong> is a helper function that handles reporting errors to the user.</li>
                </ol>
