                <p>The Interactive Data Map was developed for the Cumberland Area Economic Development Corporation to replace their existing application built with Google Maps Engine, as that platform was being deprecated.  The map showcases various businesses and cultural/recreational opportunities in and around Cumberland County, Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>The map was a custom deployment of the Esri Shortlist Story Map product.  In addition to applying a branded look, the following enhancements were added:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A toggable legend</li>
                    <li>A mobile loading screen</li>
                    <li>Custom text that appeared in the header when the “Attractions” tab is selected</li>
                </ul>
